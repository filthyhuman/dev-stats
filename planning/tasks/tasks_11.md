# Tasks 11 — Expand before starting Sprint 11

Derive atomic tasks from planning/sprints/sprint_11.md.
Follow the same format as tasks_01.md through tasks_03.md.

Rules:
- One task = one file created, one class/method implemented, or one test class written
- Each task is checkable in isolation (ruff + mypy + relevant tests all pass)
- Expand this file FULLY before writing any implementation code for Sprint 11

## Checklist
